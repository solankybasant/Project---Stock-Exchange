This repository contains code for predicting stock market prices using news articles from around the globe.

## Requirements
python >= 3.6

pandas

numpy

matplotlib

seaborn

scikit-learn


## Model
The model used for this project is a multi-layer perceptron classifier from the scikit-learn library. 
The headlines are processed using natural language processing techniques such as tokenization and stop-word removal. 
The processed data is then used to train the classifier.

## Results
The model was able to achieve an accuracy of approximately 57% on the test set. 
Further improvements can be made by using more advanced natural language processing techniques or by using a more complex machine learning model.
